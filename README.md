# Sow-and-Know
Community Food Gardening Assistant

Our website is dedicated to equipping individuals with the essential knowledge for successful planting and gardening, with a special focus on soil fertility and water management.
We aim to guide users in understanding different soil types, how to enrich them for better plant growth, and how to use water efficiently in various gardening conditions.
Additionally, we help users choose the right types of plants that thrive in specific soil environments, ensuring healthier gardens and more sustainable practices.

Key Findings:
    68% of plant owners were unaware of the specific soil type required for their plants.
    74% admitted to watering their plants based on guesswork rather than researched guidelines.
    90% of beginners used generic potting soil for all plant types.
    4 out of 5 nursery staff reported frequent customer complaints about wilting or dying plants due to incorrect soil or watering.
    Only 22% of respondents used tools like moisture meters or soil pH testers.
    Many respondents relied on social media advice, which was often inconsistent or incorrect.

Impact of Water and Soil Issues on Food Gardening in Tshwane Water Challenges
    Frequent water outages: Many areas in Tshwane, including Ga-Rankuwa, Soshanguve, and Mamelodi, experience long periods without running water due to broken pipes, illegal connections, and aging infrastructure.
    Overconsumption and supply limits: Rand Water pumps 926 million litres daily to Tshwane—22% above the permitted limit—yet some communities still receive no water.
    Unsafe alternatives: Residents often rely on water tankers, boreholes, or even fire hydrants, which may not be safe for irrigating food crops.

Impact on gardens:  
Soil Limitations
Poor soil access: Many residents use generic or nutrient-poor soil, which is unsuitable for growing vegetables like spinach, tomatoes, or carrots.
Lack of soil knowledge: Few gardeners understand how soil type affects water retention and plant health. Most do not test their soil for pH or nutrients.
No formal support: There are limited local programs offering compost, soil testing, or guidance on soil improvement.
How This Affects Food Gardening
Reduced yields: Crops grow slowly or fail entirely due to lack of water and poor soil conditions.
Food insecurity: Home gardens are a vital source of nutrition and income, especially during economic hardship. When gardens fail, families struggle to afford fresh produce.
Stifled community efforts: Initiatives to promote urban farming and backyard gardens are undermined by unreliable water and poor soil, discouraging participation.


Sow & Know
Purpose: Helps users decide what and when to plant based on seasonal and environmental conditions.

Independent Variables (inputs):
    Temperature (°C)
    Rainfall (mm/week)

    Optimal temperature range per plant
    Minimum soil moisture threshold
    Seasonal planting windows
    Germination probability mode

Green Thumb
Purpose: Provides personalized advice on watering and plant care to help gardens thrive.

Independent Variables (inputs):
    Plant type (e.g., tomato, lettuce, carrot)
    Growth stage (seedling, vegetative, flowering, fruiting)
    Temperature (°C)
    Soil moisture level (%)
    Sunlight exposure(hours/day)

Dependent Variable (outputs):
    Recommended daily/weekly water amount (liters)
    Soil amendment recommendations
    Plant stress indicators
    Irrigation schedule

Mathematical Parameters:
    Base water needed per plant
    Growth stage mulriplier

    Soil moisture retention rate
    Green Thumb Water Requirement Calculator

Water Requirement Formula
    Estimated Weekly Water (liters) = Base Water Needed × Growth Stage Multiplier × Temperature Factor\text{Base Water Need} \times \text{Growth Stage Multiplier} \times \text{Temperature Factor}Base Water Needed × Growth Stage Multiplier × Temperature Factor

Base Water Needed (liters/week per plant)
    Tomato: 10
    Lettuce: 6
    Carrot: 8
    Cabbage: 9
    Pepper: 7
    Spinach: 5
    Beetroot: 7
    Onion: 6
    Pumpkin: 12
    Maize: 10
    Garlic: 5

Growth Stage Multiplier
    Seedling: 0.5
    Vegetative: 1.0
    Flowering: 1.2
    Fruiting: 1.5

Temperature Factor
    Below 15°C: 0.8
    15°C to 25°C: 1.0
    Above 25°C: 1.2

Example Calculations:
    Example 1: Tomato plant in Fruiting stage at 30°C
    Estimated Weekly Water = 10 liters × 1.5 × 1.2 = 18 liters
    Example 2: Lettuce plant in Vegetative stage at 20°C
    Estimated Weekly Water = 6 liters × 1.0 × 1.0 = 6 liters
    Example 3: Carrot plant in Seedling stage at 10°C
    Estimated Weekly Water = 8 liters × 0.5 × 0.8 = 3.2 liters

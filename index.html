                <h2>THE GAP WE FOUND...</h2>
                <h3>Many communities, especially those with limited access to agricultural education, face challenges in successfully growing their own food.<br> A major issue is the lack of knowledge about which plants are suitable for their local soil conditions.<br> Without proper guidance, people often plant crops that fail to thrive, leading to wasted resources and discouragement.</h3>
                <h3>Additionally, even when the right plants are chosen, many community members do not know how much water each plant needs to grow healthily.<br> Overwatering or underwatering can lead to poor yields, plant diseases, or even crop failure. This lack of information prevents households from achieving food security through home gardening.</h3>

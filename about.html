                <h1>Our website is dedicated to equipping individuals with the essential knowledge for successful planting and gardening, with a special focus on soil fertility and water management.</h1>

                <h1>We aim to guide users in understanding different soil types, how to enrich them for better plant growth, and how to use water efficiently in various gardening conditions.</h1>

                <h1>Additionally, we help users choose the right types of plants that thrive in specific soil environments, ensuring healthier gardens and more sustainable practices.</h1>

                <h1>Key Findings:</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>68% of plant owners were unaware of the specific soil type required for their plants.</li>
                    <li>74% admitted to watering their plants based on guesswork rather than researched guidelines.</li>
                    <li>90% of beginners used generic potting soil for all plant types.</li>
                    <li>4 out of 5 nursery staff reported frequent customer complaints about wilting or dying plants due to incorrect soil or watering.</li>
                    <li>Only 22% of respondents used tools like moisture meters or soil pH testers.</li>
                    <li>Many respondents relied on social media advice, which was often inconsistent or incorrect.</li>   
                </ul>
                <h4>Impact of Water and Soil Issues on Food Gardening in Tshwane Water Challenges</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Frequent water outages: Many areas in Tshwane, including Ga-Rankuwa, Soshanguve, and Mamelodi, experience long periods without running water due to broken pipes, illegal connections, and aging infrastructure.</li>
                    <li>Overconsumption and supply limits: Rand Water pumps 926 million litres daily to Tshwane—22% above the permitted limit—yet some communities still receive no water.</li>
                    <li>Unsafe alternatives: Residents often rely on water tankers, boreholes, or even fire hydrants, which may not be safe for irrigating food crops.</li>
                    <li>Impact on gardens: Without consistent water, food gardens dry out, and crops fail. Farmers and home gardeners are forced to buy expensive water or abandon their gardens altogether.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Soil Limitations</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Poor soil access: Many residents use generic or nutrient-poor soil, which is unsuitable for growing vegetables like spinach, tomatoes, or carrots.</li>
                    <li>Lack of soil knowledge: Few gardeners understand how soil type affects water retention and plant health. Most do not test their soil for pH or nutrients.</li>
                    <li>No formal support: There are limited local programs offering compost, soil testing, or guidance on soil improvement.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>How This Affects Food Gardening</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduced yields: Crops grow slowly or fail entirely due to lack of water and poor soil conditions.</li>
                    <li>Food insecurity: Home gardens are a vital source of nutrition and income, especially during economic hardship. When gardens fail, families struggle to afford fresh produce.</li>
                    <li>Stifled community efforts: Initiatives to promote urban farming and backyard gardens are undermined by unreliable water and poor soil, discouraging participation.</li>
                </ul>
